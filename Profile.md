## I'm a 23 year old ex medical student wanting to enter the world of technology. I've previously studied at Kingston University where I partook in a Midwifery course from 2018-2021. However, I left due to my personal interests not alligning with Healthcare. My current hobbies are to workout at my local gym and swimming pool, video editing, photography and currently dabbling in some graphic design. 

My **favourite** website is: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) as I just find it as a universal hub for entertainment. Not only can you connect with people, but you could also view memes, trending topics, content from other websites and catch up with the news. The ***biggest appeal*** to twitter that other social media apps do not have is that Twitter *doesn't* blatantly use elements from other social medias to add to their website. For example, other social medias added the story feature from **Snapchat**, how other apps use short formed user generated content from **Tiktok**, etc. Social Media is becoming *less and less* original by the day and I believe it can shorten the length of how long a user can remain actively registered on the website.

###### My favourite TV shows:
Although, I don't watch as much TV as I used to, I do have a few select favourites:

1. Money Heist
2. One of Us Is Lying
3. Gossip Girl
4. Misfits
5. Pretty Little Liars

###### What I want to achieve in this course?:
- [] Develop my confidence back as a learner, as my previous course made me too anxious to ask for help or further my knowledge
- [x] Network with the students and teachers in my course, develop a nice support system
- [x] Be able to experiment with the knowledge that I have, either through given assignments or with my own personal projects
- [] To graduate from this course and to make myself proud
